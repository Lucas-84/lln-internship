 abstract = {Multinomial tests for the fit of iid observations X1,...,Xn to a specified distribution F are based on the counts Ni of observations falling in k cells E1,...,Ek that partition the range of the Xj. The earliest such test is based on the Pearson (1900) chi-squared statistic: X2 = Σk i=1 (Ni - npi)2/npi, where pi = PF(Xj in Ei) are the cell probabilities under the null hypothesis. A common competing test is the likelihood ratio test based on LR = 2 Σk i=1 Nilog(Ni/npi). Cressie and Read (1984) introduced a class of multinomial goodness-of-fit statistics, Rλ, based on measures of the divergence between discrete distributions. This class includes both X2 (when λ = 1) and LR (when λ = 0). All of the Rλ have the same chi-squared limiting null distribution. The power of the commonly used members of the class is usually approximated from a noncentral chi-squared distribution that is also the same for all λ. We propose new approximations to the power that vary with the statistic chosen. Both the computation and results on asymptotic error rates suggest that the new approximations are greatly superior to the traditional power approximation for statistics Rλ other than the Pearson X2. The derivation of the limiting null distribution for the Cressie-Read statistics, following that for LR, is based on a Taylor series expansion of Rλ, in which X2 is the dominant term. The same expansion produces the traditional noncentral chi-squared power approximation by considering sequences of alternative distributions for the Xj that approach the hypotheses F at a suitable rate. Our power approximations are obtained from a Taylor series expansion that is valid for arbitrary sequences of alternatives. When linear and quadratic terms are retained, an accurate but computationally difficult approximation, Aλ, in terms of linear combinations of noncentral chi-squares is obtained. A second approximation, Bλ, in terms of a single noncentral chi-squared distribution results from averaging the coefficients in Aλ. This simple approximation performs well. In the important case of the statistic LR, Aλ = Bλ and this new noncentral chi-squared approximation is very accurate. Retaining only linear terms in the expansion produces an approximation Lλ based on a normal distribution; this is generally much inferior to Aλ and Bλ.},

abstract="Methods for enumerating cryptographic keys based on partial information obtained on key bytes are important tools in cryptanalysis. This paper discusses two contributions related to the practical application and algorithmic improvement of such tools. On the one hand, we observe that the evaluation of leaking devices is generally based on distinguishers with very limited computational cost, such as Kocher's Differential Power Analysis. By contrast, classical cryptanalysis usually considers large computational costs (e.g. beyond 280 for present ciphers). Trying to bridge this gap, we show that allowing side-channel adversaries some computing power has major consequences for the security of leaking devices. For this purpose, we first propose a Bayesian extension of non-profiled side-channel attacks that allows us to rate key candidates according to their respective probabilities. Then we provide a new deterministic algorithm that allows us to optimally enumerate key candidates from any number of (possibly redundant) lists of any size, given that the subkey information is provided as probabilities, at the cost of limited (practically tractable) memory requirements. Finally, we investigate the impact of key enumeration taking advantage of this Bayesian formulation, and quantify the resulting reduction in the data complexity of various side-channel attacks.",

In this paper, we present a theoretical and experimental complexity analysis of this attack, which has been simulated 21 times using the idle time of several computers. The experimental results suggest a complexity upper-bounded by 241 DES evaluations in 85 {\%} of the case, while more than the half of the experiments needed less than 239 DES evaluations. In addition, we give a detailed theoretical analysis of the attack complexity.",

Its principle is based on a duality between differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis, and applicable to various block ciphers. Then using this program, we observe how the order of S-boxes affects the strength of DES. We show that the order of the S-boxes is well-arranged against differential cryptanalysis, though it is not the best choice. On the other hand, our experimental results indicate that it is a very weak choice in regard to linear cryptanalysis. In other words, DES can be strengthened by just rearranging the order of the S-boxes.",

We develop a formal statistical framework for block cipher attacks based on this technique and derive explicit and compact gain formulas for generalized versions of Matsui's Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. The theoretical framework allows both approaches to be treated in a unified way, and predicts significantly improved attack complexities compared to current linear attacks using a single approximation. In order to substantiate the theoretical claims, we benchmarked the attacks against reduced-round versions of DES and observed a clear reduction of the data and time complexities, in almost perfect correspondence with the predictions. The complexities are reduced by several orders of magnitude for Algorithm 1, and the significant improvement in the case of Algorithm 2 suggests that this approach may outperform the currently best attacks on the full DES algorithm.",

The scenario is a known-plaintext attack based on two new linear approximate equations, each of which provides candidates for 13 secret key bits with negligible memory. Moreover, reliability of the key candidates is taken into consideration, which increases the success rate. As a result, the full 16-round DES is breakable with high success probability if 24.3 random plaintexts and their ciphertexts are available. The author carried out the first experimental attack using twelve computers to confirm this: he finally reached all of the 56 secret key bits in fifty days, out of which forty days were spent for generating plaintexts and their ciphertexts and only ten days were spent for the actual key search.",
